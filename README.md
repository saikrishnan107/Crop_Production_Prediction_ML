# Crop_Production_Prediction_ML


Hello all, welcome to Crop Production Prediction using Machine Learning Regressions. 

Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, and accurately predicting crop production is essential for improving planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop a regression model that forecasts crop production (in tons) based on agricultural factors such as area harvested (in hectares), yield (in kg/ha), and the year, for various crops grown in a specific region.

The process steps used are Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization , Machine Learning(Regression) and finally using Streamlit application for predicting the yield of particular crops produced. 

Libraries used: Scikit learn, pandas
